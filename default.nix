# HOWTO keep this package definition up-to-date:
#
# 1. NEW VERSION:
# After the new version is tagged and pushed, update the `version` var to the
# proper value and update the hash. You can use the following command to find
# out the sha256, for example, with version 1.0.3:
# `nix-prefetch-github --rev v1.0.3 laamaa m8c`
#
# 2. NEW DEPENDENCIES:
# Make sure new dependencies are added. Runtime deps go to buildInputs and
# compile-time deps go to nativeBuildInputs. Use the nixpkgs manual for help
#
